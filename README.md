# Ecoacoustic Indices

- This is a rather small script representing a shortcut analysis alternative to the most used, or global, indices for ecoacoustic evaluation.

- It is adapted from the initial Python scripting by @patriceguyot, so it contains the same indices in the very same order.

- It takes the indices built in the R packages soundecology and seewave.

- - Run iniatilly in R version 4.0.4, with soundecology version 1.3.3 and seewave version 2.1.6

It can be changed and improved all the time as well as forked if you wish.
